_Hunts prey, follows trails, and predicts enemy moves._

A tracker is good on following trails, identifying foes on a hex, predicting movements or erasing the trail of the own party. The activies for a tracker is very time consuming, that's why although a Tracker may gain many options of tasks in it's level progression, most of the main abilities will consume the whole day for the tracker.

## Dirt Gazer

_You see tracks… if they’re fresh_

- **Follow track**. Day consuming, can follow found track. WIS CD (GM to determine) to follow a found track.
    
- **Identify creatures.** Can try to identify creatures activities in the Hex. Once per HEX can test INT CD 15 to try to identify one creature that made activities in the HEX.
    

## Seeker

_The trail speaks as clear as words_

- Can deduce recent activities of previous found creatures in the HEX, with faint perceptions like "Orcs passed here two days ago". In order to do that, test _identify creatures_ with CD 18 with modifiers from the GM to determine. In success, the Seeker can have glances of living creatures that left their tracks recently.
    
- _Follow track_ is rolled with ADV.
    

## Hunter

_You hunt what leaves no trace_

- **Erase track**. Consumes all day, while the tracker spends it's time hiding the track that the party leaves behind. The party still can be tracked, although it is much more dificult.
    
- **Spot Lair**. Found points of intereset may be tested once to try to determine if the place is a lair of a creature. Dificulty determined by the GM.
    

## Predator

_Prey prays you never follow_

- **Misleading track.** Consumes all day, while the tracker plants false tracks to anyone who follows the party to be lead to traps or, at least, to very different directions of the ones that the party are going.
    
- _Identify creatures_ is rolled with ADV.
