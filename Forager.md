_Finds food in the wild, stretches supplies, and knows nature’s dangers. Survival hinges on their skill._

The Forager is in charge of finding rations for the party. One ration is sufficient food and water for a PC for a full day.

## Berry Picker

_You find food… if it’s obvious_

Once per day the Forager may test INT in order to find food and water. The amount of rations found is equal the difference between the test and the CD, divided by two, rounded down and minimum 1.

The CD changes depending on the biome, as follows:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Biome**|**CD**|
|Desert|18|
|Forest / Jungle|12|
|Hills|13|
|Mountains|15|
|Plains|13|
|Swamp|15|
|Tundra|16|

## Root Digger

_What don't kills you makes you stronger_

The forager may decide in either:

- Roll the test for forage with ADV;
    
- Instead of rolling the test for forage, find 2 rations.
    

## Collector

_You know which plants won’t kill you_

- The forager decreases the CD of every biome by 3.
    
- If the party has a PC as Medic it may help foraging for medicinal herbs. The Medic reroll one additional die for it's _care for all_ ability.
    

## Feaster

_You could feed an army with twigs_

The test for finding rations does does not divide the difference between the CD and the result by two.
