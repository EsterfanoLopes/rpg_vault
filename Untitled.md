In the years when the dunes learned to speak and the peaks forgot their songs, the stone remembered a door. It did not open; it relented. Water came without a river—clear, consecrated by thirst—and the granite parted like a mouth that had been patient too long. From the inside of the rock, where feet are rumors and light is a guest, six shapes stepped out of a single silence.

One carried daylight on a blade and thought truth was a road without shade; his kindness was heavier than his judgment, and the blade refused to be dark. One smelled of far salt and near steel and could turn timber the way wind turns pages; ropes understood her hands, and weapons understood her patience. Two were dragons who were not dragons: the first was scaled in wanting, small enough to slip through the teeth of a lock; it collected doors as others collect coins. The second wore thinking like a cloak; its flames kept books, and its water moved where wells cannot. One was an arrow that learned to be a person; pale as mercy, bronze at the hip, the line between aim and arrival. One bore a red ring that was a prayer and a warning, and those who cherished ruin found their courage absent in his shadow.

The stone spoke: From within stone and by the water that opens, the hamad will return to the red peaks. The scourge will count its skies and discover the last of them.

But stones hoard ambiguity. Perhaps daylight is only polished metal and truth is a road with many junctions. Perhaps salt is grief and ropes are promises. Perhaps dragons are twin thoughts that never meet, or twin pockets that never empty. Perhaps bronze is memory and the red mark a story told to frighten sand. Perhaps water is a lie doors tell to imitate miracles.

Listen for the signs that doubt can hear: when the desert drinks and does not thirst; when a blade warms instead of burns; when a ship travels where no river agrees; when treasure forgets its name and knowledge remembers its source; when faith alarms and fear sanctifies. Then the dunes will climb like stairs, and the peaks will open their red mouths to receive the hamad. The scourge will pass counting victories and lose its number. Or so the hollow stone says, and the sacred stream agrees, and the wind—unwitnessed—nods.
