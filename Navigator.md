A navigator needs to have navigation tools set or to roll navigation tests with DIS.

## Guide

_You follow trails… when marked_

Navigator in unfamiliar territory must ask for GM to make a hidden INT check upon exiting a HEX. On a failure, the group moves a random adjacent HEX. **The players should not be informed immediatelly.** See Getting Lost to know how to proceede with a lost party.

- Party does not get lost if following an obvious geographical landmark (river, lake, coast), unless per magical methods.
    

## Wayfinder

_You will always find a way_

- You can guess cardinal directions (N/S/E/W) accurately unless magic interferes.
    
- Time per hex is reduced 1/2 if you have navigation tools and a proper map (minimum 1 hour).
    

- If your party got lost, you realize it after 3 HEX.
    

## Stargazer

_You navigate by unseen currents_

- Reroll one Navigation Check per day. Use the best result.
    

- If your party got lost, you realize it after 2 HEX.
    

## Skyreader

_The sky is your map_

- You roll Navigation checks with ADV.
    

- If your party got lost, you realize it after 1 HEX.
