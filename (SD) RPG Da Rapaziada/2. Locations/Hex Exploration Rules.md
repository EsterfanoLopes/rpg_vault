### Weather
Roll d6 for wind

| d6    | Wind                     |
| ----- | ------------------------ |
| 1     | **Horrible**(*Sandstorm) |
| (3:6) | *Sandstorm               |
| 2-5   | **Normal**               |
| 6     | **Good**                 |

- **Horrible**: Terrain increases cross difficult. (Normal becomes Difficult, Difficult becomes Impossible). 
	- 3:6 **Sandstorm**: Lasts 1d4 (don't reroll for weather). Reduces visibility to near
- **Good**: Weather is excellent. Roll next weather with ADV and not Temperature roll
---
if not Good, roll 2d6 for Temperature

| 2d6   | Day       | Night     |
| ----- | --------- | --------- |
| 2     | Inferno   | Very Hot* |
| 3-7   | Very hot* | Hot*      |
| 8-9   | Hot*      | Warm      |
| 10-11 | Warm      | Cool      |
| 12    | Cool      | Chilly    |
**Hot**: Travelling creatures requires one extra ration per day
**Inferno**: Traveling creatures takes 1d6 damage each hour
### Journey
Choose a navigator, which will define the destiny and trace the route. If the navigator is not familiar with the region or he/she is not following an obvious guide, like an river or a road, then a Navigation test is necessary. For that, test INT wit difficulty Hard (CD 15), or Extreme in case of a Sandstorm (CD 18). If fails, roll in the table below and move to the selected direction.

| Failed Navigation d3 | location |
| -------------------- | -------- |
| 1                    | Left     |
| 2                    | Target   |
| 3                    | Right    |

### Pace
The navigator must decide the travel method and pace. For method, the way of transport should be chosen, usually by foot, by mount or vehicle. Then, check if **Push** is desired. When pushing, +50% additional speed, but the random encounter chance increases in one and it is not possible to execute any of the additional party roles, as foraging, per example.
Then how much Hexes the party has as credit is calculated . For each joined hex: 
- 1 is removed from the credit, or;
- 2 in case of Difficulty terrain.
### Activities
In activities, rolls related to other party roles happens.
Each character can assume one role. Multiple characters can assume the same role, except the Navigator role.

#### Forager
Foragers can roll once per day to check if they find food and water. A success roll means that the forager found enough food and water to count as a ration per day. For that, check INT versus the difficulty per terrain. Desert CD 18
### Encounter
Check for encounter twice at morning and twice at the night. When pushing, add +1 to the chances of encounter.
When there is an encounter, roll d12 to determine the Hour. Then change to crowling rounds (SD 112).
- Check Distance
- Check Activity
- Moral test

### Wrapup
PCs can live without rations for 3 days in a row. After that, damage 1d4 CON per day (Death at 0). When a ration is consumed from that, one last day is removed from the row, which means that it needs to eat food for 3 days in a row to reset the counter.
