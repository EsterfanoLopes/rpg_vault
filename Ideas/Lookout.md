## Watchful

_You spot threats… sometimes_

A party with a lookout has:

- ADV in checks for being surprised or ambushed by foes;
    
- May test WIS to try to have a **glance** of the around nearby HEXES ahead. The better the test succeeds, more hexes may be glanced this way.
    
    - Use glance once per day
        
- A Watchful Lookout knows by it's **glance (when it succeeds = true or false)** if the biome for the next Hexes will change or not.

|CD|Number of Hexes|
|12|1|
|15|2|
|18|3|

_For example, the Watchful Lookout from the party tested WIS and had a 16 as result. It means that it achieved "Number of hexes: 2". It means that in the direction that the party is going, this hability will affect two nearby hexes in that direction._

## Vigilant

- The Vigilant Lookout can take two watch shifts in the camp without suffer any penaulties;
    
- The **glance** hability now can determine the main biome before entering the Hex;
    

## Guard

_You see the arrow before it’s loosed_

- Party/Camp cannot be surprised while you are in watch;
    
- Use **glance** twice per day;
